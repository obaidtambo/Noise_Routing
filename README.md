# Instructons For Usage
Noise Driven Route Planning Using Simulated Annealing and Enforced hill climbing Algorithm

# run the main.py file in the Code folder
It has all the pre required instructions

* The program will prompt you to enter the starting and ending tuples as x and y co-ordinates.
* The program will then ask for your choice of optimization algorithm: 1 for Simulated Annealing and 2 for Enforced Hill Climbing.
* If you choose Enforced Hill Climbing, the program will recommend using default settings. If you choose Simulated Annealing, you can choose to enter your own values for number of iterations, step size, and temperature. If you choose not to enter any values, the program will use default settings.
* Once the algorithm has finished optimizing the route, the program will output the best route found along with its score and a plot of the * * scores over the iterations.

## Note: If you encounter any input errors or do not enter any values for the optional parameters, the program will use default values.


## Required Libraries
This program requires the following libraries:

* numpy
* matplotlib
* librosa
* pillow
* tqdm

Make sure to install them beforehand (latest versions should be compatible)

# File Structure oF Code folder
The code consists of two files:

* route.py - contains the algorithm functions for Simulated Annealing and Enforced Hill Climbing and Fittenss Functions
* main.py - contains the driver code and the Instructions
* ZOOM0001_comp.wav - Audio file


### Note: All the files should be in the same folder
